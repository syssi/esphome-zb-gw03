## Warning

We have writen these instructions with care, but we will give absolutely no warranty. Perhaps you
will destroy your lamp and your computer.

## Tools needed

* Something flat f.e. a guitar clip to open the case
* Soldering Iron
* A serial to USB adapter (for example FTDI) that can provide 3.3V RX/TX signals
* Some wires


## Opening the case, to expose the PCB

*Tip: you can click on all images from below to view them in full size.*

Detach the bottom lid from the rest of the device, exposing the PCB. This might take a bit of force. Just pull it off bit by bit, until it pops loose.

## Solder wires to the board

The wires will be connected to the debug pads that are shown in the following image. Solder the wires to the `RX`, `TX`, `GND`, `3.3V` and `GPIO0` debug pads.

## Connect the wires to your serial to USB adapter

Make sure that your adapter uses 3.3V for the RX/TX pins that you will connect to the device. Some of
these adapters allow you to switch between 3.3V and 5V using a switch or a jumper. Do not use an
adapter that only provides 5V output. Reason for this, is that the ESP32 chip works at 3.3V. I have
seen the chips accept 5V serial input (I did flash the lamp successfully like that), but I am not
sure if they are actually 5V tolerant. Better safe than sorry in such case!

The wires must be connected as follows:

  | Soldering point| Serial USB Adapter name  |
  | -------------- |:------------------------:|
  | GND            |  GND                     |
  | TX             |  RX                      |
  | RX             |  TX                      |
  | 3.3V           |  3.3V                    |

To be able to flash the device, `GPIO0` must be connected to ground (`GND`) while the device boots up.
Flashing will *not* work if you connect these wires *after* the device has already been booted up.
In the following images, you will see one solution, using male dupont wires.

<img src="../images/008.jpg" width="400">

You can now connect the serial to USB adapter to your computer. Pay special attention to the
cross-over of the TX/RX pair (TX connects to RX and vice versa).

Because `GPIO0` is connected to `GND`, the device should start up in download mode.

## Make a backup of the current firmware

Backing up the firmware makes it possible to revert to the original firmware, in case you have
problems with the ESPHome firmware. The backup can be created using "esptool". Installation
instructures can be found here:

  https://github.com/espressif/esptool/blob/master/README.md#installation--dependencies

Here's an example on how to backup the original firmware by the esptool read_flash command:

```
$ python esptool.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 read_flash 0x0 0x400000 oem-firmware.bin
esptool.py v3.2
Serial port /dev/ttyUSB0

```

`/dev/ttyUSB0` is the port of the USB adaper on Linux. You can find what port is used by the adapter
by running `dmesg` after plugging in the USB device. On Windows this is often `COM1`, `COM2` or
`COM3`.

## How to restore the backed up firmware

In case you need to rollback to the gateway's original firmware at some point, here's an example of how
to restore the original firmware, by fully flashing it back onto the device.

First, bring the device into the download mode (`GPIO0` is connected to `GND`), then start the esptool write_flash command:

```
python esptool.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash 0x0 oem-firmware.bin
```

Be patient after the upload reaches 100%. The output is silent while esptool tool is verifying that
the firmware was uploaded correctly.

## Flash ESPHome firmware

Setup an ESPHome Project (see [README.md](../README.md)), compile the firmware for the gateway and
flash the firmware to the device:

```
$ esphome run example.yaml

From here on, it is possible to flash the device OTA (over the air, which means that the firmware is
uploaded over WiFi) from ESPHome. Therefore, it is now time to tuck away or remove those soldered
wires.

## Add the ESPHome node to Home Assistant

* Add the ESPHome integration
* As soon the new ESPHome device is online it should be discovered automatically
* Goto the integration page and configure the new ESPHome device
* The new device plus some entites are available now

## Flash the Zigbee module

Turn "download mode" switch ON and toggle "zigbee reset" switch once.

```
$ telnet 192.168.132.225 6638

```

Turn "download mode" switch OFF and toggle "zigbee reset" again. The Zigbee module will boot into the new firmware now.

## Connect the device to the ZHA integration of Home Assistant

* Goto the integration page of Home Assistant
* Use the "Add integration" button
* Search for "ZHA" (Zigbee Home Automation)
* Choose "Enter Manually" at the serial port selection dialog
* Choose "EZSP" as type of your Zigbee radio
* The serial device path is `socket://esphome_node_name.local:6638` (f.e. `socket://zb-gw03.local:6638` if you use the `example.yaml`). Enter `115200` baud as port speed and the "data flow control" is `software`
